# MABE
Version 2 of the [Modular Agent-Based Evolver framework](https://github.com/Hintzelab/MABE).

MABE is a software framework deigned to easily build and customize software for
evolutionary computation or artificial life.  The resulting systems should be
useful for studying evolutionary dynamics, solving complex problems, comparing
evolving systems, or exploring the open-ended power of evolution.

MABE version 2.0 is being re-built from scratch, using the [Empirical library](https://github.com/devosoft/Empirical).
Our goal is to allow for more modular control, flexible agents, faster run times
and portability to the web.
