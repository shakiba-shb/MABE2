MAJOR PROJECTS
- Setup the concept of genomes throughout MABE with a comprehensive interface.
- Setup Organisms to be built from arbitrary brains and geneomes.
- Setup Web interface (for both graphical config and doing runs)
- Update config files in many ways, but especially:
    * Handling array types.
    * Allowing for mathematical expressions to be calculated at run-time based
      on current values.
    * Come up with a clean way to distinguish whether identifiers are config
      variables, organism traits, and population traits.
    * Printing longer (multi-line) comments.
- Setup organisms that need to be processed and ideally even processed
  asynchronusly and interactively.

- FIX evaluation system.  Instead of being limited to an evaluation phase,
  evaluator modules should be able to indicate on a trait that if it is needed
  to call them.  Ideally with a caching option as well...  For computationally
  intensive evaluations, this will allow them to only be called when needed.
